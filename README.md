# Covid19 Cases Analysis in Manitoba
## Description:
> Using a multiple linear regression model to predict the outcome of covid19 cases in Manitoba.
> I used R to analyze the relationship of active postive cases and amounts of days with Recovered Rate factor.
>> 1. Data is retrieved from gov of mb health and inserted into csv file.
>> 2. p-value is less than 0.05 that means there is a stronger evidence that the result is statiscally significant. 
>> 3. Gradually, the graph is forming a Bell-shaped and it becomes a nonlinear relationship which would be investigated further.

## Remarks
> In the future, I will implement web scraping tool to retrieve a data from the gov of mb website as well as continous intergration and analysis into R.
